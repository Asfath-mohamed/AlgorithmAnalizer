Algorithm Assignment - Linear, Binary, Bubble, and Quick Sort/Search

This project contains four Java programs, one per team member.
Each program measures the time taken by a specific algorithm.

Files:
1. SharedArrays.java        → Common file to generate random arrays
2. LinearSearch.java        → Member 1
3. BinarySearch.java        → Member 2
4. BubbleSort.java          → Member 3
5. QuickSort.java           → Member 4

How to Compile:
Open terminal or command prompt in this folder and run:

    javac SharedArrays.java LinearSearch.java BinarySearch.java BubbleSort.java QuickSort.java


How to Run:
Each member runs only their file.

Example:
    java LinearSearch
    java BinarySearch
    java BubbleSort
    java QuickSort


Output:
Each program displays:
- Algorithm name
- Input sizes: 100, 500, 1000
- Execution time (milliseconds)
- Verification result (found index or sorted status)

Notes:
- All programs use the same random numbers using SharedArrays.java
- No additional or advanced features were added.
- Code follows assignment PDF instructions exactly.
